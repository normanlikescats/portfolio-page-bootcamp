    <h2>About this project</h2>
    <p class = 'about-me'>This project was a basic HTML website showcasing 4 delicious recipes from 2 different cuisines. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform for displaying recipes and providing easy access to cooking instructions and ingredients. The site was built using HTML and CSS, creating a simple and elegant design that showcases the recipes in a visually appealing way. The 2 cuisines featured on the site were selected based on their popularity and range of flavors. The 4 recipes were chosen to provide a diverse representation of each cuisine and offer a range of cooking difficulties to cater to all skill levels. The site includes clear instructions, ingredient lists, and photos to help users successfully create the dishes at home. Overall, this project was a great opportunity to put my HTML skills to the test and create a useful resource for food lovers everywhere.
